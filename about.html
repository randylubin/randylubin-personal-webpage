    			<h3>ABOUT RANDY</h3>
    			<div class="divider-div"></div>
    			<p>I'm active in the SF tech scene - advising, mentoring, and consulting with startups. Recently, I've given lectures on entrepreneurship here in California and at academies in India and Malaysia. I'm also exploring my own startup ideas, coding on side projects, and designing board games.</p>

          <h4>TECH</h4>

          <p>I've been fascinated with the accelerating pace of technology since my dad gave me a copy of a Ray Kurzweil book in high school. I'm convinced that tech is will continue to change the world in massive ways and I'm dedicated to making sure those changes are positive.</p>

          <p>My latest focus has been around the future of the economy and labor. Trends relating to automation, freelancing, micro-entrepreneurship, and inequality are going to overhaul how much of society engages with work.</p>

          <p>I'm also a big fan of programming. A few years ago, I taught myself how to code and I love it. It's incredibly empowering and a lot of fun, in addition to being the most versatile and expressive creative tool.</p>

          <h4>LECTURING</h4>

          <p>I give talks on entrepreneurship, negotiations, and learning to code. I have lectured about startups and mentored teams at <a href="http://www.innovatedelhi.com">Innovate Delhi Entrepreneurship Academy</a> and <a href="http://academy.mymagic.my/">MaGIC Startup Academy</a> in Malaysia. The videos and slides from my MaGIC talks are on their site and the topics are <a href="http://academy.mymagic.my/a-deep-dive-into-business-models-revenue-strategy/">Business and Revenue Models</a>, <a href="http://academy.mymagic.my/developing-your-market-opportunity-hypothesis-metrics/">Key Startup Models Frameworks</a>, and Intro to Negotiations. Please email me about speaking opportunities.</p>

          <h4>GAMES</h4>

          <p>I like games (board, video, etc) for a lot of reasons but mostly for their ability to foster creativity, induce flow state, train intuition, and bring people together. As an indie game designer and I enjoy analyzing games, mechanics, and systems. My most recent release is <a href="http://plotypus.com">Plotypus</a> - a collaborative storytelling game. I love making games but I only aim for it to be a hobby, a perfect outlet for excess creativity.</p>

          <h4>BACKGROUND</h4>

          <p>I grew up in Livingston, NJ and went to Washington University in St. Louis for an undergrad degree in business. While on campus, I led the committee responsible for throwing large music festivals and helped start a music related non-profit.</p>

          <p>After graduating from WashU, I entered Stanford's MBA program. I focused on technology and entrepreneurship, learning in the classroom and through consulting gigs with local startups. I also started teaching myself to code. After graduating from Stanford, I gave myself time to work on my own startup. I spent several months iterating through ideas, continuing to hone my coding skills, and consulting for SF startups.</p>

          <p>Over the months, I consulted twice with the Meetings.io team, and helped them pivot to become the current product. In the spring of 2012 they asked me to join full time as the &quot;business guy&quot; and I gladly accepted.</p>

          <p>As Meetings.io's COO, I had my hands in Marketing/PR, Strategy, Finances, Legal, and even did a bit of coding. By fall 2012 most of my time was dedicated to M&amp;A discussion with a potential acquirer: Jive Software. We sold to Jive in November 2012.</p>

          <p>Post-acquisition I spent several months as the Product Manager for the Real-Time (chat, video, etc) team, developing the roadmap and getting buy-in from the execs. In February 2013 I switched to the corp dev team. There, I helped with M&amp;A, partnerships, and long-term strategy. In September 2013, I left Jive to return to the startup world. Since then I've been consulting, exploring startup ideas, creating games, tinkering on side projects, and keeping an eye out for cool teams to join.</p>
