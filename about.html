    			<h3>ABOUT RANDY</h3>
    			<div class="divider-div"></div>
          <p>I'm the founder of <a href="https://leveragedplay.com/">Leveraged Play</a>, a consulting firm that designs and runs games that help organizations explore the future and explain the present. Most recently, I ran business operations and growth at <a href="https://www.remotion.com">Remotion</a>.</p>
          
    			<p>I'm active in the SF tech scene - advising, mentoring, and consulting with startups. I've given entrepreneurship talks around the world and love travel. I have plenty of side-projects and am an indie game designer - I publish my games at <a href="http://diegeticgames.com">Diegetic Games</a>.</p>

          <h4>TECH</h4>

          <p>I've been fascinated with the accelerating pace of technology since my dad gave me a copy of a Ray Kurzweil book in high school. I'm convinced that tech will continue to change the world in massive ways and I'm dedicated to making sure those changes are positive.</p>

          <p>My latest focus has been around the future of the economy and labor. Trends relating to automation, freelancing, micro-entrepreneurship, and inequality are going to overhaul how many people engage with work.</p>

          <p>I'm also a big fan of programming. A few years ago, I taught myself how to code and I love it. It's incredibly empowering and a lot of fun, in addition to being the most versatile and expressive creative tool.</p>

          <h4>LECTURING</h4>

          <p>I give talks on entrepreneurship, negotiations, and learning to code. I lectured about startups and mentored teams at <a href="http://www.innovatedelhi.com">Innovate Delhi Entrepreneurship Academy</a> and <a href="http://academy.mymagic.my/">MaGIC Startup Academy</a> in Malaysia. The videos and slides from my MaGIC talks are on their site and the topics are <a href="http://academy.mymagic.my/a-deep-dive-into-business-models-revenue-strategy/">Business and Revenue Models</a>, <a href="http://academy.mymagic.my/developing-your-market-opportunity-hypothesis-metrics/">Key Startup Models Frameworks</a>, and Intro to Negotiations. Please email me about speaking opportunities.</p>

          <h4>GAMES</h4>

          <p>I like games (board, video, etc) for a lot of reasons - especially for their ability to foster creativity, induce flow state, train intuition, and bring people together. As an indie game designer, I enjoy analyzing games, mechanics, and systems. I publish my games at <a href="http://diegeticgames.com">Diegetic Games</a> and they're all free! I love making games but I only aim for it to be a hobby, a perfect outlet for excess creativity.</p>

          <h4>BACKGROUND</h4>

          <p>I grew up in Livingston, NJ and went to Washington University in St. Louis for an undergrad degree in business. While on campus, I led the committee responsible for throwing large music festivals and helped start a music related non-profit.</p>

          <p>After graduating from WashU, I entered Stanford's MBA program. I focused on technology and entrepreneurship, learning in the classroom and through consulting gigs with local startups. I also started teaching myself to code. After graduating from Stanford, I gave myself time to work on my own startup. I spent several months iterating through ideas, continuing to hone my coding skills, and consulting for SF startups.</p>

          <p>Over the months, I consulted twice with the Meetings.io team, and helped them pivot to become the current product. In the spring of 2012 they asked me to join full time as the &quot;business guy&quot; and I gladly accepted.</p>

          <p>As Meetings.io's COO, I had my hands in Marketing/PR, Strategy, Finances, Legal, and even did a bit of coding. By fall 2012 most of my time was dedicated to M&amp;A discussion with a potential acquirer: Jive Software. We sold to Jive in November 2012.</p>

          <p>Post-acquisition I spent several months as the Product Manager for the Real-Time (chat, video, etc) team, developing the roadmap and getting buy-in from the execs. In February 2013 I switched to the corp dev team. There, I helped with M&amp;A, partnerships, and long-term strategy. In September 2013, I left Jive to return to the startup world.</p>

          <p>Before joining my next venture, I consulted, designed games, and worked on side projects. I'm most proud of designing the storytelling game <a href="http://plotypus.com/">Plotypus</a> and making <a href="https://democracy.io/">Democracy.io</a> which empowers citizens to write to their legislators.</p>

          <p>I then joined FactoryX, an intense startup experiment with goal of creating a new startup every ten weeks. I created an internal platform for coordinating teams and the vast amounts of feedback we gathered. Then I switched to an Entrepreneur in Residence role where I helped with several ideas. When FactoryX wound down, I joined <a href="https://www.plethora.com">Plethora</a> to help create the future of manufacturing. There I created their marketing and sales teams and was the interim head of marketing for almost a year.</p>

          <p>In 2020, I advised and then joined <a href="https://www.remotion.com">Remotion</a>, a team video chat startup. My role was running business operations and growth. I helped Remotion launch their public beta, raise their Series A, and grow their weekly active teams by 100x.</p>
