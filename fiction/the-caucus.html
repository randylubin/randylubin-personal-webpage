          <br>
          <p>Musetta sat by herself on an overstuffed couch, toying with her name
          badge as she glanced around the delegate lounge. At 18, she was the
          youngest participant by a few years; most attendees were over 40. She
          had been here for over an hour and the only people she had talked to
          were the woman working the registration desk and the attendant at the
          buffet.<br />
          Other delegates entered the lounge in small groups or had struck up
          conversations with attendees milling about. Everyone else seemed at
          ease; they were likely experienced participants in Liquid Democracy
          caucuses and acquainted with each other from industry events or
          political gatherings.<br />
          Musetta stared out the resort’s massive floor-to-ceiling windows while
          she waited for the next presentation, gazing at the cliffs crashing into
          the Pacific Ocean. She worried that she didn’t belong at the event and
          that she didn’t have anything to contribute. She opened her Liquid
          Democracy app, stared at her delegate count, and told herself that the
          30,000 friends and neighbors had entrusted her with their votes for a
          reason. They were relying on her to make an informed vote on the Gene
          Banking Proposition. Her delegate count was high enough to qualify for a
          short speaking slot on stage, later that afternoon. She switched to her
          notes app to review her pre-written speech.</p>
          <p>A man approached her, glancing between her name badge and the tablet
          in his hands. “Ah Musetta. Hi, I’m Gaige Stanwick from a think tank
          called the Center for Genetic Futures.” He wore a blazer and button down
          but no tie and he radiated confidence.<br />
          “Nice to meet you, Gaige.” She shook his hand.<br />
          “You’ve got a great story, very sympathetic. I assume you’re voting for
          compulsory gene banking?”<br />
          Musetta was surprised that he knew about her. Did he have research on
          all of the delegates? “I actually haven’t decided which version I’m
          voting for. Obviously I’m in favor of gene banking, but I also care
          about privacy and so do the folks who gave me their vote.”<br />
          A tiny frown crossed Gaige’s face before turning into a broad smile.
          “I’m sure you’ll come around. We’re recording pro-banking messages in
          the PR suite later. Come by once you’ve made up your mind.” He surveyed
          the lounge before settling his eyes on a woman in a pantsuit. “Ah,
          that’s the congresswoman from Bakersfield. Pardon me.”<br />
          The sympathetic story that Gaige referenced involved Musetta’s younger
          brother Neri. He had mytozyme syndrome, an untreatable disease, but
          Musetta was hopeful that broader gene banking would help researchers
          find a cure. Together, she and Neri had organized a local gene banking
          drive in their hometown of Stockton to try to speed things along. He was
          mostly bed-bound but still helped with the planning and promotion. The
          drive had a great turnout and led to her giving a talk at a city council
          meeting, which set her on a path to qualifying for this delegate caucus.
          Every step of the way, Neri encouraged her, tracking her vote count more
          closely than she did.</p>
          <p>“Ugh, lobbyists.” came a voice from behind her.<br />
          Musetta turned to see a young woman dressed in jeans and a t-shirt. The
          shirt featured a slogan which was obscured by an attendee badge which
          read Shelby Kleij. Musetta glanced back at Gaige before replying.
          “Lobbyist? He said he works for a think tank.”<br />
          “Same thing. He’s funded by Fractal Life Sciences or BaseBase or Glial
          Digital or… all of them.” Shelby grimaced.<br />
          “Well, he was pushing me to back compulsory banking.” Musetta paused to
          stare at the woman and figured out that her t-shirt read <em>Tank the
          Bank</em>. “You’re not anti-biotech, are you?”<br />
          Shelby chuckled. “No. Biotech <em>research</em> is fine, it’s just the
          companies I can’t stand. They’re trying to steal all of our private
          data!” She paused for a moment, trying to sense if Musetta was
          sympathetic to her cause. “Hi, I’m Shelby. I’m with the Student Privacy
          Association. Where do you go to school?”<br />
          “San Joaquin High School over in Stockton, I’m a senior. you?”<br />
          “I’m a junior at Cal Berkeley. I run our local SPA chapter and also have
          votes delegated to me from a bunch of other UC chapters. You care about
          privacy, right?”<br />
          “Of course. But, the current proposals say that gene banks will be held
          in a public trust. So companies can’t just steal the data, right?”
          Musetta wasn’t an expert on privacy but she was pretty sure there were
          safeguards against misuse.<br />
          “The biotechs are going to do whatever they want with our data and they
          don’t care who gets hurt when it gets used against us. And inevitably
          it’ll leak, just like with the massive insurance breach that happened
          last year.”<br />
          “But gene banking can save lives. My brother is sick and we’re hoping
          that gene banking will help with a cure. That has to be worth it.”<br />
          “Oh, I’m sorry.” Shelby blushed and glanced away. “I hope your brother
          finds a cure, I do. It’s just that the privacy risks are way too high.
          I’ve had friends dropout of school after their personal data was leaked.
          Private messages, journal entries, STD tests… given enough time,
          everything becomes public.” The two women stood quietly for a moment
          before Shelby broke the silence “I’m going to get some air before the
          next speaker. See you around.”<br />
          Shelby left the lounge and Musetta sat back down on one of the couches.
          She wasn’t sure what to make of Shelby or Gaige but it felt good to be
          talking with other delegates. She thought about the recent insurance
          breach, which had revealed massive volumes of personal information. She
          and her classmates had snickered when they found that their principal
          had received treatment for warts. Her generation had grown up online and
          been told from a young age to take privacy seriously. Yet with so much
          information in corporate databases, there was a limit to what any
          individual could do. She knew that the folks who had delegated their
          votes to her did care about privacy and about healthcare research.</p>
          <p>This delegate caucus was an all day event, open to delegates
          entrusted with at least 25,000 votes. Delegates with a high enough vote
          count were invited to speak on stage to share their community’s needs
          and perspectives. At the end of the caucus, delegates would decide which
          version of the Gene Banking Proposition, if any, would be added to the
          California ballot that November. Then, the general public would have
          their say via a simple yes or no vote.<br />
          This process was part of a recent set of experiments in civic
          participation under the category of Liquid Democracy. Citizens could now
          vote on more issues, and with more nuance. Rather than dig into the meat
          of every issue, most voters chose to delegate their vote to someone they
          trusted, usually someone who shared their values but knew a bit more
          about the topic. That delegate could, in turn, pass their votes onward
          to a third person. The original voters could always recall any delegated
          votes but that rarely happened. In practice, most folks delegated their
          votes and then forgot about the issue altogether.<br />
          The proposed versions of the Gene Banking Proposition sought to improve
          scientific understanding of medical disorders by creating huge libraries
          of individuals’ genomes and their ongoing health information, all while
          maintaining personal privacy. Then researchers could use the vast data
          platform to derive insights and develop breakthrough therapeutics. The
          proposals varied on a few dimensions: would participation be mandatory,
          opt-in, or opt-out; how intellectual property would work; how the system
          would be funded; who would manage the platform and safeguard user
          privacy?</p>
          <p>A gray-haired woman sat down next to Musetta, carrying a plateful of
          pastries. She immediately recognized the woman as Dr. Keliwy, the famed
          science communicator. Musetta tried not to stare but then the older
          woman turned and offered her plate.<br />
          “I grabbed too many, and I know I’ll regret eating all of them. Want
          one?”<br />
          Musetta stared at the assortment and tentatively grabbed a chocolate
          croissant. “Thanks. I, um, we watched your video on DNA synthesis in my
          AP Bio class. It was super helpful.”<br />
          Dr. Keliwy smiled, “That was a fun series to record! I’m glad that it’s
          helping students. What’s your name?”<br />
          “Musetta”<br />
          “Hi Musetta, I’m Dari Keliwy. I’d shake your hand but…” She waved her
          crumb-covered hands. “What brings you to the caucus today?”<br />
          “I think gene banking can be this amazing thing, if we do it right. When
          my brother got sick, I organized a big drive in my town and got a bunch
          of folks to sign up. When the topic was added to this season’s ballot
          measures, most of my town delegated their votes to me.”<br />
          “That’s wonderful. Is your brother okay?”<br />
          “For now… Neri has mytozyme syndrome but the doctors have prevented it
          from getting worse.”<br />
          “That’s good. I read a recent preprint from Dr. Idonije’s lab at UCSF.
          It sounds like they might know the pathway through which mytozyme
          damages cells, which could make it easier to find a cure.”<br />
          “That’s great, Neri and I will read it when I get home tonight; we try
          to stay on top of all the latest research.” She paused for a moment, not
          sure what else to say to her. “So what are you doing here? I figured
          someone like you would be too busy to come to a caucus.”<br />
          “I’m not a real celebrity, I just play one on TV.” Dr. Keliwy smiled.
          “Hundreds of thousands of people trust me with their votes when it comes
          to scientific issues; I take that incredibly seriously. I attend a dozen
          caucuses a year to try to better understand the issues and to help shape
          policy.”<br />
          Gentle chimes sounded by the door to the lounge and Dr. Keliwy checked
          her watch. “Five minutes until my talk, I need to go backstage to mic
          up. Great meeting you Musetta.”</p>
          <p>Dr. Keliwy’s talk was well attended and most delegates paid close
          attention to her explanation of the scientific potential of gene
          banking. Neri was watching from home and messaged Musetta with a running
          commentary on the nuances. After Dr. Keliwy left the stage, Musetta
          approached her in the hallways for a few technical follow-up questions
          and the scientist answered them with a smile.<br />
          During the break between speakers, Musetta went outside for a walk along
          the resort’s coastal path. She walked toward the edge of the cliff and
          stared at the Pacific breakers rolling in and crashing upon the rocky
          beach. A few yards away, she saw a man setting up a tripod and clearly
          struggling with the wind as he prepared for a video shoot. He wore a
          hoodie with a cartoon illustration of an exploding brain.<br />
          The man waved her over, “Yo, can you help me hold this steady?”<br />
          “Sure!” Musetta recognized him as Alden Jackson, a famous video
          streamer. He was in his late twenties and most of her classmates watched
          him daily.<br />
          “Sweet, I’m trying to get this view in my background but the wind isn’t
          cooperating. I just need a quick intro for today’s show. Oh I’m Alden by
          the way, you might know me from my channel ‘Whoa Science!’ or ‘Extreme
          California!’”<br />
          “Hi, I’m Musetta. My brother Neri loves your shows.”<br />
          “Nice! Let’s take a selfie for him.” They posed for her camera and he
          made a brain exploding gesture with his hands. “Ok, let’s record this
          intro.”<br />
          She held his tripod steady as he recorded a short welcome and overview
          for his show.<br />
          “Eh, good enough. I’ll record the rest in the PR room where we can get
          good audio.” He gave Musetta a closer look. “Are you part of Gaige’s
          Young Influencer program? Want to do a co-stream?”<br />
          “I’m not in his program. I’m actually new to all of this.” She gestured
          vaguely toward the resort. “I’m up to do a co-stream though!”<br />
          “Yeah, sure, let’s do it. Here, you carry the tripod, I’ll grab the
          camera case.”<br />
          A few minutes later, they were all set in the PR suite and ready to go
          live. Gaige, the lobbyist, entered during the mic check and Alden gave
          him a thumbs up. Alden turned to Musetta before starting the stream.
          “We’ll just have a chill conversation about gene banking and what we’re
          thinking, no pressure.”<br />
          “What up ‘Whoa Science!’ fans! We’re here in beautiful Half Moon Bay at
          the Liquid Democracy caucus for gene banking, getting ready to vote on
          the future of biotech. I’d like to introduce you to Musetta, my co-host
          for this stream, and to give a shout out to her brother Neri, a huge fan
          of the show.”</p>
          <p>The next few minutes blurred by. Alden started the stream politely
          but he turned combative when she pushed back on his position that gene
          banking should be compulsory. Whenever she tried to share a counter
          argument or cite a study, he would interrupt and explain why she was
          mistaken and how his views were obviously correct.<br />
          “As always, thanks for trusting me with your votes. I’m voting for the
          future we all deserve!” Alden grinned at the camera and ended the
          stream. Musetta sat in silence.<br />
          Alden took off his lapel mic and checked the stream’s stats. “Nice, over
          100k views, not bad for an impromptu stream. I gotta talk to Gaige,
          thanks for coming on the stream, Musetta.” He smiled at her and walked
          off.<br />
          Musetta exited the PR suite in a daze and crumpled into a plush armchair
          in the hallway. Her phone buzzed with a message from her brother, “Ugh.
          Done being an Alden fan. U got this!”</p>
          <p>A few minutes later, Shelby came by and sat down next to her. “Rough
          stream, huh?” The college delegate had clearly seen some of Musetta and
          Alden’s conversation. “Alden is a jerk and totally in the pocket of
          biotech. If you’re going to go on his stream, you can’t play his game;
          you’ve got to seize the initiative and pelter him with questions.”<br />
          “I was blindsided.” Musetta shook her head. “He was so nice before he
          turned the camera on.”<br />
          “He’s just out for himself. Can’t afford to look bad on stream or it’ll
          cost him his biotech payout.”<br />
          “They’re buying his vote?” Musetta looked askance.<br />
          “Pretty much, though they won’t call it that. He knows that if he
          supports their positions, they’ll sponsor his videos.”<br />
          “That’s messed up”<br />
          “Yeah. They have funds to buy all the votes they need. Liquid Democracy
          is no less corrupt than representative democracy, it’s just a bit more
          convoluted.”<br />
          “But you think that you can change delegates’ minds right?”<br />
          “Not really. There’s no path to the Student Privacy Association actually
          winning today’s vote, but caucuses are a great place to make a scene and
          draw some attention to our cause.” Shelby leaned in and lowered her
          voice. “You know, if you wanted to get back at Alden, we could catch him
          on camera admitting to being in biotech’s pocket.”<br />
          Musetta thought for a second before replying. This was clearly not how
          Liquid Democracy was supposed to work but would she be able to make a
          difference? “I don’t know, this all seems risky.”<br />
          “Nah,” said Shelby, “The real risk is that Alden’s support causes the
          compulsory version of gene banking to win at this caucus and then the
          public all votes yes in November.”<br />
          Musetta frowned at the prospect and then nodded to Shelby. “Okay, I’m
          in.”<br />
          Shelby shared her plan with Musetta, giving her tips for how to appeal
          to Alden’s ego and how to have him reveal the unsavory side of Liquid
          Democracy, where influencers and influence peddlers worked together.</p>
          <p>“So Alden, I was hoping you could give me some advice about gaining
          more votes, becoming an influencer, and maybe even getting
          sponsorship.”<br />
          “For sure, I have a few minutes before my next stream.” Alden was
          sipping coffee on the patio, taking a break from video editing.<br />
          Musetta was trying hard not to glance at Shelby, who was live streaming
          their conversation from the next fire pit over. “Thanks! So what’s the
          fastest way to grow delegates?”<br />
          “It’s all about focus and balance. You want to pick issues that are
          interesting enough to stream about but not so personal that folks are
          going to want to keep the vote themselves. Then learn just enough to
          know the lingo, but don’t waste time becoming an expert. You can always
          use AI to fill in the gaps when you need to.” He paused and looked at
          her with a measure of doubt. “You seem like you actually care about gene
          banking but you’ll have to hype yourself for other issues too. Don’t
          take this the wrong way, but you don’t really give off influencer vibes.
          Are you sure you want to be one?”<br />
          Musetta’s mind raced as she tried hard not to look over at Shelby and
          not to think about how many live viewers might be people that she knew.
          She had to keep him talking. “Yeah, I totally want to be an influencer.
          This is my first caucus and I’m a bit intimidated being around folks
          with such high vote counts, especially those who are such great
          showmen.” She gestured at him. “But I’ll get used to it… and gene
          banking is only the start for me.”<br />
          The flattery seemed to work and Alden grinned. “Ok, but it takes hard
          work. Next tip: you’ll want to be a bit controversial, a bit edgy.
          That’ll help you stand out and grab votes from other influencers. It’s a
          zero-sum game. Try getting into drama with folks who have their own
          audiences but only pick fights you know you can win.” He smiled with his
          mouth but not his eyes. “Oh and don’t you dare try that against
          me.”<br />
          “I wouldn’t think of it.” Mussetta fidgeted with her badge. She needed
          him to say something shady, something involving the lobbyist. “How about
          getting sponsorships? That’s the real goal, right?”<br />
          “Hell yeah. You’ve gotta pick issues that have big money involved. Like:
          homelessness issues are generally a waste of time unless there’s a big
          developer involved. But the optics can be rough so…” He juggled his
          hands, balancing the risks. “And you’ll want to separate your Liquid
          Democracy content from whatever you want sponsored to get around
          campaign finance laws. I support biotech friendly policies on my
          democracy streams but the corporate sponsorship is for my Whoa Science
          videos.”<br />
          “I can’t actually say that I’ll support their policies in exchange for a
          sponsorship, right?”<br />
          “Definitely not. It’s a relationship game, like anything else. Make
          friends with Gaige and join the young influencers program. Then, publish
          content that supports their positions. You can bring up sponsorship
          later, once you’ve shown that you’re aligned on policy. Oh and see if
          you can get invited to any junkets; they flew me to Maui last month for
          a set of synth-bio talks and…”<br />
          Alden broke off as Gaige stormed onto the patio, waving his phone while
          flanked by security guards. “Stop talking, you’re on stream right now.”
          Gaige’s phone showed the stream from Shelby’s phone, with thousands of
          live viewers. Alden stopped talking and looked around in confusion. The
          security guards surrounded Shelby and told her that she had violated the
          caucus’s privacy policies and that she had to leave the property
          immediately.<br />
          Before she turned the corner, Shelby looked back at Musetta with a
          smile. Alden caught the glance and narrowed his eyes at Musetta. “This
          was a setup? You are so done.” He stormed off in the direction of the PR
          lounge.</p>
          <p>Musetta walked back into the resort and sat down for another talk.
          She struggled to focus, worrying instead about the fallout from the
          stream. Halfway through the session, her phone started buzzing with
          notifications. Alden had published a rant that accused her of trying to
          “cancel” him and of violating the caucus’s principles. He encouraged his
          followers to let Musetta know what they thought about her actions.
          Trolls were tearing through her internet presence, leaving nasty
          comments on public posts and encouraging her supporters to revoke their
          votes. She saw Neri replying to some of them and she messaged him to
          knock it off. Nothing good comes from arguing with trolls.<br />
          Unfortunately, Aldens rant was having an impact on her delegated votes.
          Already, one scandal-averse member of Stockton’s city council had
          revoked his vote and, along with it, the votes of several thousand of
          his constituents who had delegated their votes to him. Perhaps worse,
          she saw her classmates talking about the incident on social media and
          quite a few were supporting Alden.<br />
          She got up from her seat and sped to the bathroom, where she hid in a
          stall and tried to not cry. She was huddling on the seat, clearing
          notifications and blocking trolls, when she received a message from the
          caucus team. Too many people had revoked their votes, enough that her
          vote count had fallen below the caucus threshold. They weren’t going to
          kick her out, but they were taking away her speaking slot.<br />
          She messaged Shelby, asking for advice and received a quick reply. “It’s
          all part of the game, don’t worry about it. And hey, clips from the
          stream are circulating online so folks are seeing how the system is
          corrupt.”<br />
          “I don’t think Liquid Democracy is corrupt, just influencers like
          Alden.”<br />
          “Can’t have one without the other.”<br />
          That didn’t sound right to Musetta but she wasn’t going to argue with
          Shelby over chat messages. She thought about how she’d lost her chance
          to speak to the caucus and how it felt like she had let herself and her
          community down. She heard footsteps and failed to stifle sob as someone
          else entered the bathroom.<br />
          “Everything alright in there?” Dr. Keliwy’s voice echoed in the
          bathroom.<br />
          “Yes. No. I’ve messed up.” Musetta came out from the stall and explained
          the situation.<br />
          “That’s really rough. I still have trolls come after me and it doesn’t
          get easier. The best thing you can do is ignore them and they’ll lose
          interest. Alden will move on soon, too. Fighting with a high school girl
          won’t look good for him; I wouldn’t be surprised if his publicist makes
          him delete his rant and he pretends it never happened.” Dr. Keliwy shook
          her head. “He’s cynical and he’ll do what’s best for his numbers.”<br />
          “I hope so.” Musetta stared at her hands. “Even still, I’ve let down
          everyone who trusted me with a vote. I thought this was my shot at
          representing them and maybe influencing the caucus… but it’s clear that
          I don’t belong here.”<br />
          “That’s not true at all. It’s clear to me, from our earlier
          conversations, that you have a good grasp of the issues and that you
          understand the science better than most of the delegates.” Before
          Musetta could object, Dr. Keliwy continued. “But Liquid Democracy isn’t
          about giving one’s vote to the most knowledgeable expert, it’s about
          weighing your values and factoring them into any decision. Your
          community didn’t delegate their votes because of your science knowledge,
          they did so because they trust that you share their values and that you
          care enough to make the best decision for them.”<br />
          “Thank you, Dr. Keliwy, I needed to hear that.” The tension left
          Musetta’s shoulders as she felt the stress from the past hour fade. She
          held out her phone. “I want to record an apology to everyone who
          delegated their vote to me, would you hold the camera for me?”<br />
          “Of course, but let’s film somewhere that isn’t the bathroom.”<br />
          The two walked back outside to the patio, where sun was beginning to set
          over the Pacific. Musetta took a moment to record a heartfelt message.
          She reaffirmed how much the Gene Banking Proposition meant to her and
          her brother and that she regretted letting Alden distract her from the
          purpose of the caucus. Then, she summarized some of the key arguments
          from the day’s sessions and shared how she was planning on voting.<br />
          Musetta took her phone back from Dr. Keliwy and used the Liquid
          Democracy app to share it with the 20,000 folks who still had their
          votes delegated to her. She let out a long exhale. “Thanks doctor, I
          appreciate it.”<br />
          “You’re welcome.” Dr. Keliwy stared at her for a moment, nodding her
          head in thought. “Musetta, I need to leave the caucus early; my team
          needs my help with a minor crisis. I won’t be here for the closing
          session or the final vote. It’s clear that we’re aligned on the key
          issues around gene banking and I want to delegate all of my votes to
          you. Will you stay and vote on my behalf, and on behalf of everyone who
          has entrusted me with their vote?”<br />
          Musetta’s eyes widened. “Yes, of course! I can’t tell you how much your
          trust means to me. I won’t let you down.”<br />
          “Thank you and good luck. I know you’ll make the right decision.”<br />
          Dr. Keliwy said goodbye and left the caucus. Musetta spent a few minutes
          taking in the sunset before she received a text from Neri, “837,503!!!”
          followed by a screenshot of the Liquid Democracy vote tracker.
          Dr. Keliwy had delegated her hundreds of thousands of votes to Musetta.
          She stared at the number, trying to imagine all of those people whose
          votes had been delegated onward and upward until they reached her.<br />
          “Pardon me Miss.” A member of the caucus team had walked up to her.
          “Based on the current vote allocations, you’re now one of the top
          delegates. That gives you the right to make a speech during our final
          session. We’re prepping backstage now. Are you interested?”<br />
          Musetta didn’t hesitate. “Yes, count me in!”</p>
